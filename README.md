Welcome to TerminalOSbeta | Created by UserLuigi
# Information
TerminalOS is a mini OS created using Python. TerminalOSbeta is the beta version of TerminalOS, coming soon. There haven't been any testers besides me, so I only know if it works for MacOSX. It will be confirmed soon.
# Features

(If there is a * next to a feature, it hasn't been finished just yet.)
A username feature (it doesn't save due to errors)
A few fun games to play*
A built in basic calculator*
Much more to do!
# Commands
So far there are only 2 working commands. Type 1 for a help command (which isnt done because i am lazy :/) Type 3 for a game of Hangman.
